Plugin Activator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Activator** class is generated by the `create plug-in wizard <Creating%20a%20Plugin.html>`_
and is responsible for managing the life cycle of your plugin.

The focus of the Activator class is Resource Management:

-  Internationalization support via `Plugin Internationalization with
   ResourceBundles <Plugin%20Internationalization%20with%20ResourceBundles.html>`_
-  Management of system resources using utility classes like ImageCache, FontCache and so on
