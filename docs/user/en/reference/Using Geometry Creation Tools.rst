This geometry is used as the starting point when creating a new
feature (you will sill need to fill in the attributes).

Tip: When Advanced Edit Mode is active many of these geometry creation
tools can also be used for editing existing features as well. This is
convenience to allow you to quickly correct your data entry work while
reducing the amount of times you need to switch tools.
