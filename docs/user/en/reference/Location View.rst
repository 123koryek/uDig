Location View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The location view is used as a front end to geocoder services,
allowing you to type in the address and find a location.

The location view is not included in the default persepective, you
will need to use **Windows > Show View > Location** to open this view.



The format used in the address bar is rather strict at this time.
