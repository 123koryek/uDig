Working with fast views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Projects view has now been converted into a fast view. This
section will demonstrate what can now be done with it.


#. Confirm that the shortcut bar at the bottom left of the window
   still has the Projects view and looks like this: > <img src="download
   attachments/3581/shortcutbar.jpg" align="absmiddle" border="0"/>
#. In the shortcut bar click on the Projects fast view button.
#. Observe that the Projects view slides out from the left side of the
   window. > <img src="download attachments/3581/fastviewenabled.jpg"
   align="absmiddle" border="0"/>
#. The Projects fast view can be used as it would be normally. To
   resize a fast view, move the mouse to the right edge of the fast view
   where the cursor will change to a double-headed arrow. Then hold the
   left mouse button down as the mouse is moved.
#. To hide the fast view simply click on another view or editor or
   click on the Minimize button on the fast view's toolbar. > <b>Note<
   b>: If a map or page is opened from the Projects fast view, the fast
   view will automatically hide itself to allow the file to be worked
   with.


To convert a fast view back to a regular view either:


#. Choose Fast View from the context menu of the icon in the top left
   corner of the view.
#. Drag the fast view icon from the tool bar, and drop it somewhere in
   the Workbench window.
