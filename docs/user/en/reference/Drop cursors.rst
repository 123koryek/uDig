Drop cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drop cursors indicate where it is possible to dock views in the
Workbench window. Several different drop cursors may be displayed when
rearranging views.
Dock above: If the mouse button is released when a dock above cursor
is displayed, the view will appear above the view underneath the
cursor. Dock below: If the mouse button is released when a dock below
cursor is displayed, the view will appear below the view underneath
the cursor. Dock to the right: If the mouse button is released when a
dock to the right cursor is displayed, the view will appear to the
right of the view underneath the cursor. Dock to the left: If the
mouse button is released when a dock to the left cursor is displayed,
the view will appear to the left of the view underneath the cursor.
Stack: If the mouse button is released when a stack cursor is
displayed, the view will appear as a tab in the same pane as the view
underneath the cursor.
