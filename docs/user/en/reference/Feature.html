       <h3>Feature</h3>
       <p>A Feature literally represents something that can be drawn onto a map. Features may represent real world objects like a building; or be abstract such as voting districts.</p>

<p>When more than one feature of the same type exist; you can group them into a feature collection; each feature is said to belong to a feature type.</p>
