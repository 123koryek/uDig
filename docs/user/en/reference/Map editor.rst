Map editor
~~~~~~~~~~

In the Map Editor,you can visualize and edit spatial information. The
spatial information is organized into a series of Layers.



Please note that many support views are designed to facilitate the use
of the Map Editor; often making use of it for display and interaction.



Tools
-----

Interaction with the Map Editor is defined by the current tool being
used. Tools are primary found in the tool palette on the right of the
map, although custom tools for specific needs can be found in the
appropriate view.

You can hide and show the tool palette by clicking the small arrow on
the top right of the palette ( ) and ( ). This can be useful if you
need more room to view your map and have little need for the tools.

The selected tool will be displayed with a highlighted background as
in the image below

To find different tools click the draw corresponding to the tool set
you wish to use, each draw will contain different contextual tools,
for instance the Pan Tools draw has tools for panning around the map
and the Editing draw has tools specifically for editing features.

Tools are arranged into the following categories:


+ `Edit Tools`_
+ `Georeferencing Tools`_
+ `Information Tools`_
+ `Navigation Tools`_
+ `Selection Tools`_




Context Menu

The context-menu depends on the tool being used (and the kind of
content it is working with). The context menu is used as a short cut
for the operations available in the `Edit Menu`_.

the context of the current map.
