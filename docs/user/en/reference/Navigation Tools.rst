Zoom Tool
~~~~~~~~~

The Zoom tool allows the user to zoom towards or away from the map.
> The Zoom tool provides the following options:< p>

+ If the left mouse button is clicked then the zoom is towards the
  map. The point clicked is the new center of the display after the
  zoom.
+ If the right mouse button is clicked then the zoom is away from the
  map. The point clicked is the new center of the display after the
  zoom.
+ If the left mouse button is dragged to form a box then the box
  indicates the new area that will be displayed on the screen (a zoom
  in).
+ If the right mouse button is dragged to form a box then the area on
  the screen during the drag will be fit into the box (a zoom out).
+ Rotating the mouse wheel will zoom towards or away from the map,
  keeping the center of the display the same.
