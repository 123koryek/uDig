Use of Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **view** is a visual component within the Workbench. It is typically
used to navigate a hierarchy of information (such as the layers in a
Map), open an editor or display properties.

Modifications made in a view are saved immediately. Normally, only one
instance of a particular type of view may exist within a Workbench
window.



Use of Views
------------

Views support editors and provide alternative presentations or
navigations of the information in the Workbench. For example:
> <img src="download attachments/3551/catalog.gif" align="absmiddle"
border="0"/>

The Catalog view displays all data services known to the application
along with the names of the layers within them. The Projects view
displays the projects and other resources. A view might appear by
itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.

To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook, simply click its
tab. The Workbench provides a number of quick and easy ways to
configure an environment, including whether the tabs are at the bottom
or top of the notebooks.

Views have three menus. The first, which is accessed by right clicking
on the view's tab, allows the view to be manipulated in much the same
manner as the menu associated with the Workbench window.
> <img src="download attachments/3551/catalogtab.gif"
align="absmiddle" border="0"/>

The second menu, called the "view pull-down menu", is accessed by
clicking the down arrow . The view pull-down menu typically contains
operations that apply to the entire contents of the view, but not to a
specific item shown in the view. Operations for sorting and filtering
are commonly found on the view pull-down.

Finally, the contents of a view may have a context menu. This menu is
determined by the item selected in the view, and thus provides
consistent functionaly across all views.

> A view can be displayed by selecting it from the <b>Window > Show
View< b> menu. Additional views are available by choosing **Other...**
at the bottom of the Show View submenu. This is just one of the many
features that provide for the creation of a custom work environment.
