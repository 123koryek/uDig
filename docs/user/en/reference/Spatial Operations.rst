Spatial Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Introduction
============

This is the root page of the user documentation for the **uDig**
*Spatial Operations* extensions. `Axios`_ is providing under the
`Spatial Operations and Editing Tools`_ project promoted by the
**Diputación Foral de Gipuzkoa**, ` **Departamento de Movilidad y
Ordenación del Territorio**`_.

These extensions comprise a set of Spatial Operations, where each of
them work over the features of one or more input layers and generally
populate a new one with the features resulting of applying the
specific Spatial Operation.
To enable the *Spatial Operations* view, go to Window->Show
View->Other as shown in *Figure 1*. The *Show View* dialog will pop
up, then select the *Spatial Operations* item from the tree view as
shown in *Figure 2* and press *OK* **Figure 1 Open others views**
**Figure 2 Open the Spatial Operations View**
Once you told uDig to open the *Spatial Operations* View, it'll be
shown as in *Figure 3*.

Remember Views in **uDig**, as in most RCP based applications are very
flexible. So if the standard layout does not seem appropriate for you,
try changing its position by dragging the tab title, setting it as a
*Fast View* so its only shown when needed, or set is as a *Detached*
view so it behaves like a dialog.



Spatial Operations
------------------

Check the links bellow for specific user documentation for each of the
available extensions.


+ `Buffer Operation`_ Computes a buffer area around the selected
  geometries.
+ `Clip Operation`_ Computes the geometric difference between two
  Layers.
+ `Dissolve Operation`_ Creates a new layer containing the Features
  grouped and merged by the selected Property.
+ `Fill Operation`_ Creates a new features using the boundary of
  polygons and the provided LineStrings
+ `Hole Cut Operation`_ Makes a hole inside a polygon feature using a
  lineString feature
+ `Intersect Operation`_ Computes the geometric intersection between
  two layers.
+ `Polygon to Line Operation`_ Transform a polygon layer into a
  LineString layer
+ `Spatial Join Operation`_ Creates a new layer containing the
  features from the second layer that match the indicated spatial
  relation.
+ `Split Operation`_ Split a polygon layer using a LineString layer
