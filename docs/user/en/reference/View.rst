Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well as
ways to navigate the information in your Workbench. For example, the
Projects view displays projects and other resources that you are
working with.

Views also have their own menus. To open the menu for a view, click
the icon at the left end of the view's title bar. Some views also have
their own toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view
toolbars only affect the items within that view.
> A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a
tabbed notebook. You can change the layout of a perspective by opening
and closing views and by docking them in different positions in the
Workbench window.< p>
