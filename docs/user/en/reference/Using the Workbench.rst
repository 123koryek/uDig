Using the Workbench
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The uDig application offers an integrated "workbench" in which many of
the views work together to perform common GIS tasks.

The following tasks highlight this organisation (with respect to
concepts such as boundary and selection which are used
collaboratively).
