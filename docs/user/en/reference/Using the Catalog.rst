Using the Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The uDig Catalog lists the data currently imported into application.
This is of information you are working with. Information is not
automatically copied to your local computer or visualised on your
maps. Your Catalog can list files stored on your machine, databases
published on your LAN, or web services available on the Internet.

Data is made available using services ranging from databases
(containing a resource for each table) down to simple files (which
often contain a single resource representing their content).
