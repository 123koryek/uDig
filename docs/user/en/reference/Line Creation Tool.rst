lines can be edited. A summary of the advanced editing features are:


+ Clicking an existing line will select it.
+ An existing line can be extended by



#. Clicking on a line to select it > <img src="download

+ Vertices in selected lines can be moved.
+ Vertices in selected lines can be added or deleted
+ Holding CTRL+SHIFT down will allow the entire geometry to be moved.
+ As with the `Edit Geometry Tool`_ the vertex operations can be
  performed on multiple vertices at once if many vertices are selected.
