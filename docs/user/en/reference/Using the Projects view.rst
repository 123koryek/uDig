Using the Projects view
=======================

The Projects view is used to navigate through the projects and maps in
the Workbench. Each project can have multiple maps and other resources
inside it. They are the top-level elements in the Projects view. The
example below shows multiple projects with maps in them.



To open a map or page editor from the project view:


+ Double click on a Map or Page
+ Select the Map (or Page), right click to bring up the **context
  menu** and select **Open** > <img src="download
