Workbench
=========

The term workbench refers to the desktop window that is displayed. The
workbench contains editors and views allowing you to interact with
spatial information.

You can change what views and editors are displayed by changing
"perspectives". Each perspective defines an arrangement of views and
editors allowing you to focus on one problem or activity.

Out of the box uDig includes:


+ `Map Perspective`_ - used to work with and explore spatial
  information
+ `Style Perspective`_ - used to work on styling spatial data in a
  distraction free environment
