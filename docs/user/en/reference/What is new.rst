+ Area of Interest
+ Tool Interaction
+ Tool Palette and Options
+ Cheatsheets



+ `What is new 1.1.0`_
+ `What is new 1.2.0`_




Area of Interest
================

We now support the concept of `Area of Interest`_:


+ This replaces the previous default value of "everything"
+ You can define an area of interest a number of different ways:
  current screen, a bookmark, the current projection
+ You can use Area of Interest to:

    + Limit the contents of the `Table view`_
    + Limit the area you are searching for new data in the `Search view`_
    + Show All



For more information check out the Tasks section on `Working with
AOI`_



Tool Interaction
================

You can now control how a layer interacts with tools.

One great use of this facility is to quickly mark background layers so
they do not get in the way of what you are working on.



Tool Palette and Options
========================

Tools have gotten a major usability improvement featuring:


+ **ToolPalette** - used to quickly explore available tools, configure
  tool display to show labels, large icons or even descriptions for a
  helping hand when learning. > <img src="download

  Map; you can also Choose <b>Show View > Other< b> and Open the
  Palette on its own as a tear off View. This is great for users with
  more than one monitor or when you have multiple maps open side by
  side. This is the same Palette used during Page printing.
+ **ToolOptions** - quick access to common tool preferences from the
  Map Status Line. This has allowed us to reduce the number of tools
  while maintaining the same functionality. > <img src="download

These change combine to make uDig even more User-friendly with a
presentation of tools similar to a paint program.



Cheatsheets
===========

Cheatsheets offer a great form of interactive help to supplement the
existing uDig online help reference
> material.<br >
> Cheatsheets offer step by step instructions; with the ability to
interactively take charge of the application and show you the step
that is being described.< p>
