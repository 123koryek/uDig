Using the File menu to add a new Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create new projects by using the **File > New** menu on the
Workbench menubar.

Start by creating a simple project as follows:


#. From the menubar, select **File > New > Project** > <img
   src="download attachments/3543/newproject.gif" align="absmiddle"
   border="0"/>
#. In the New Project field, type a filename. (You may also use the
   Browse button)
#. Click Finish when you are done.


If you look at the Projects view, you will see that it now contains
your new project.
