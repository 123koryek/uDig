~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hole Cutter tool allows holes to be selected, cut and edited. The
hole cutter has the following functionality:


+ Clicking within an existing polygon will start the creation of a
  hole. Creating a hole is the same as creating a polygon using the
  Polygon Tool except that creation is restricted to within the polygon.
  Notice that the created vertex is within a selected polygon > <img

+ Clicking an existing hole will select it.
+ Vertices in selected holes can be moved when in Advanced Edit Mode.

+ Vertices in selected holes can be deleted when in Advanced Edit
  Mode. > <img src="download attachments/8864/deletevertex.png"

+ As with the `Edit Geometry Tool`_ the vertex operations can be
  performed on multiple vertices at once if many vertices are selected.
