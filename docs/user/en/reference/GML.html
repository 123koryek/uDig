       <h3>GML</h3>
       <p>An XML document containing spatial data. Often these documents are captured on disk as a file with the extension ".gml".</p>

<div>
<ul>
    <li><a href='#GML-GMLFiles'>GML Files</a></li>
    <li><a href='#GML-GeographyMarkupLanguage'>Geography Markup Language</a></li>
</ul></div>

<p>Please be aware that a "gml" file is actually a normal XML document; it just happens to be a document is based on the "abstract" Geographic Markup Language specifications.</p>

<h1><a name="GML-GMLFiles"></a>GML Files</h1>

<p>GML files in udig can currently only be supported if they meet two very strict restrictions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>filename.xsd - an xml schema document defining the "data product" being loaded</li>
	<li>filename.gml - an xml document defined against the schema provided above</li>
</ul>


<p>We only support GML2 based schemas with simple content at this time. There is improved GML support for WFS 1.1 access; this has not been packaged for offline use at this time.</p>

<h1><a name="GML-GeographyMarkupLanguage"></a>Geography Markup Language</h1>

<p>Most markup language specifications are published with the idea of defining a document format that applications can use to share information. I am afraid that "GML" handles things a little bit differently - it provides an XML Schema that can be used as a starting point when an organization defines a data product.</p>

<p>As such we really do need access to the description of the data product in order to open up a "gml document".</p>
