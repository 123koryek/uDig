Perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~

A perspective defines the initial layout of views in the workbench
window.

Often perspectives are defined to facilitate a specific task, or bring
together views targeted for working with a specific resource. In
addition a perspective can control what appears in certain menus and
toolbars.
