       <h3>Symbology</h3>
       <p>Symbology is the cartographic practice of representing information using symbols (and colours) on a Map.  The <a href="Legend.html" title="Legend">Legend</a> offers a quick summery of the symbology used for a <a href="Map.html" title="Map">Map</a>, often presenting important layers of information in groups for easy reference.</p>

<p>For Layers with complicated symbology (perhaps listing icons, or changing colour based on attribute) the symbology will change on a feature by feature basis to reflect the values being communicated by the map.</p>

<h2><a name="Symbology-GeneralCartography"></a>General Cartography</h2>

<p>Maps produced for general use showing a wide range of features. The maps are often produced against a set standard as part of a series.</p>

<p>The definition of the symbology used is provided by an organisation or government body; often with very exacting requirements that can difficult to reproduce exactly!</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Maps used for emergency response will often dictate the set of symbols used (in keeping with the training of the operators)</li>
	<li>Maps used for nautical navigation where lives are at risk based on the exact interpretation of the map provided. You will often find datasets containing a disclaimer that their information is not suitable for this purpose.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="Symbology-ThematicCartography"></a>Thematic Cartography</h2>

<p>This is the most common use for a desktop mapping application such as uDig. In this case the map is produced in order communicate information around a specific dataset; with a map of the physical location serving as a background.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choropleth: differences in colour or shading used qualitative differences in an attribute.
	<ul>
		<li>Useful when the polygons are all roughly the same size; or you run the risk of making larger polygons appear more important.</li>
		<li>A Dasymetric map is the opposite of this where the features are generated in order all be a similar size.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Proportional Symbol: Change point symbol size based on an attribute to illustrate relative values. ** Remember when mapping an attribute to symbol size (i.e. radius) the visual effect is not linear and you may wish to adjust accordingly.</li>
	<li>Contour: A great way to render raster values such as height or atmospheric pressure where lines are drawn along the edge of value changes revealing shapes in the underling data; and the distance between these lines showing a rapid change in value.</li>
	<li>Dot: used to represent individual observations or measurements</li>
</ul>


<p>These maps are often used for purposes such as exploring data or scientific visualisation. Depending on the dataset and information being communicated a number of techniques may be employed.</p>
