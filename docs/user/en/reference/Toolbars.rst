Toolbars
--------

There are *three* kinds of toolbars in the Workbench.


#. The Main Toolbar (or Workbench toolbar) > Displayed at the top of
the Workbench window directly beneath the menu bar. Items in the
toolbar might be enabled or disabled based on the state of either the
active view or editor. You can rearange sections of the main toolbar
using the mouse.< li>
#. Individual View Toolbars > These appear in the title bar of a view.
Actions in a view's toolbar apply only to the view in which they
appear. Some view toolbars include a Menu button, shown as an inverted
triangle, that contain additional actions for that view.< li>
#. The fast view bar > A toolbar that contains icons representing the
   current set of fast views. A fast view is a shortcut to a view that is
   frequently used; see the section on fast views for more information.
   The fast view bar appears in the bottom left corner of the workbench
   by default. However, it is possible to position it on the left or
   right as well.< li>
