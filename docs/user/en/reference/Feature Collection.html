       <h3>Feature Collection</h3>
       <p>Vector data is represented as a collection of features; this terminology comes from the Web Feature Server specification; which is a web service that makes vector data available over the web as "feature collections".</p>

<p>You can think of a feature collection as being the data; and the feature type as being the data contents.</p>
