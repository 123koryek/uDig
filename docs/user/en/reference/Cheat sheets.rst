Cheat sheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cheat sheets guide you through the steps used to complex a common
task.

Each cheat sheet is focused on completing a specific task, and lists
the steps required to achieve that goal. As you progress from one step
to the next the cheat sheet will launch the required tools for you. If
their is a manual step involved, the cheat sheet will tell you want
action to perform and offer a button to advance to the next step.

Cheatsheets also link to the relevant help information in this user
guide saving you a documentation search.
