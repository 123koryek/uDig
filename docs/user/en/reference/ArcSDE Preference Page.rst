ArcSDE Preference Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ArcSDE Preference Page is used to configure ArcSDE support in
uDig.



Configuration
=============

These settings are used to tell uDig where the "jars" are for version
of ArcSDE. These jars are included on your ArcSDE CD. We cannot
distribute the jars with uDig.



ArcSDE Java SDK
---------------

This is a jar similar to "jsde-sdk-XX.jar" where XX is the version
number of ArcSDE you are using.

Please copy this jar to your computer from the ESRI CD and hit Browse
to tell uDig where the jar is.



Projection Engine:
------------------

This is a jar similar to "jsde-jpe-XX.jar" where XX is the version
number of your ArcSDE server.
