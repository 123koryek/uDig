<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-CheatSheetSelectionDialog"></a>Cheat Sheet Selection Dialog</h1>

<p>1. Select <b>Help &gt; Cheat sheets</b> from the menubar<br/>
2. Select one of the available cheat sheets and click <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>You may also load a cheat sheet content file or from the internet.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Starting"></a>Starting</h1>

<p>Each cheat sheet has a list of steps and it always begins with an Introduction step. When you launch a fresh cheat sheet, the Introduction step is expanded so that you can read a brief description of the cheat sheet. To start working with the cheat sheet, click Click to Begin  in that step. The next step is expanded and highlighted. You should also see one or more actions buttons, such as Click to Perform   in the highlighted step. You can now begin working through the tasks using the cheat sheet. At any time, the only highlighted step in the cheat sheet is the current step.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Restarting"></a>Restarting</h1>

<p>Any time after starting a cheat sheet, you can restart from the first step by clicking Click to Restart   in the Introduction step. If you have already created some artifacts, you will have to manually clean up the workspace before restarting the cheat sheet.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Progressingtothenextstep"></a>Progressing to the next step</h1>

<p>In the current step, when you click Click to Perform  , a tool (which can be a wizard), will be launched and you will be required to work with that tool. When you finish working with that tool, the next step is automatically highlighted and it becomes the current step. When the current step is a manual task, you will need to perform the work and click Click to Complete   to move to the next step. A check mark   appears in the left margin of each completed step.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Gettingtaskhelpinformation"></a>Getting task help information</h1>

<p>To get step-by-step instructions for that step, click the help link   in the step before you click Click to Perform  , and the step-by-step instructions on how to work with that tool will be displayed in the Help window.</p>

<p>Additional help for entry fields in the tool or wizard may be available by focusing on the field (use the Tab key to position to that entry) and pressing F1.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Skippingastep"></a>Skipping a step</h1>

<p>If a current step has a Click to Skip option  , then it is an optional step. You must click Click to Skip   to skip the current step, when you do, the step will have the skip mark   in the left margin. If the task does not present Click to Skip, you must perform that step and you cannot skip it.</p>

<p>Redoing a step</p>

<p>You can redo any step that you may have completed or skipped in the current cheat sheet. To redo the step, expand the step by clicking its expand  icon and then clicking Click to Redo  . After redoing a step, the cheat sheet will continue from the redo step.</p>

<h1><a name="Workingwithcheatsheets-Closing"></a>Closing</h1>

<p>When you finish the last step in a cheat sheet, it automatically restarts. You can also close the active cheat sheet by clicking the close icon  in the cheat sheet's toolbar. The active cheat sheet saves its completion status when it is closed so that you can continue where you left off at a later time.</p>
