       <h3>Legend</h3>
       <p>A <a href="Map.html" title="Map">Map</a> legend is a quick visual guide to understand the image of the map. As such it needs to explain the information being presented; the use of colour on the map, and any symbols or icons used.</p>

<p>In cartographic terms the Legend is used to describe the map (i.e. "Map Menu") and as a summary of the colours and icons used (i.e. "symbology").</p>

<h2><a name="Legend-MapDefinition%28Mapmenu%29"></a>Map Definition (Map menu)</h2>

<p>A legend is used to quickly allow the user to identify visually they layers of information shown on the screen.</p>

<p>If the layers are communicating several types of information; they legend may group these together.</p>

<p>Note that not all map layers are required to be listed in the legend: Often background layers are omitted to allow the user to focus on the key information being displayed.</p>

<p>Other common Map menu items include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Map Title: Describing the region or purpose of the Map</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="Legend-ColourandIconsUsed%28Symbology%29"></a>Colour and Icons Used (Symbology)</h2>

<p>For Layers that produce complex symbology further detail to explain the symbols will be needed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continuous: When theming on a continuous value such as <b>height</b> often a smooth gradient of colour is used</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Categorisation: When categorising information into groups the groups will need to be listed and provided a unique colour and appearance</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>Symbol Definition: When using distinct icons (or glyphs) to represent data points each shape will need to be listed along with a definition of what the symbol means. <br clear="all" /> This can be relaxed when using a standard or well under known symbology set such as provided by MIL2525b or Emergency Response symbols for which the operator has been trainined.</li>
</ul>
