Set raster transparent color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raster files often have a set colour that is used to indicate "no
data". This occurs where a satellite field covers a diagonal swath of
territory that does not line up with a rectangular image. It can also
occur where simple line work (such a topographical map) is recorded on
a white background; by marking the background as transparent you can
see through to the other layers.


#. Select your raster layer
#. Open the **Style Editor** dialog using the button on the **Layers**
   view toolbar
#. Choose the **Raster Color Mask** style page
#. Press the **checkbox** to **Enable color mask**
#. Press the color chooser and select the color to be made transparent

#. In the original image the white background is opaque preventing you
   from seeing the elevation map layer. > <img src="download

   width="75%+height=75%"/>
#. This is result of setting transparent color to white; allowing the
   elevation map in yellow to show through: > <img src="download
