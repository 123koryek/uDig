~~~~~~~~~~~

The Polygon Creation Tool allows polygons created. To create a polygon
simply select a polygon layer in the `Layers view`_ and click to begin
a new polygon and continue to click at new locations to add more
vertices.

preference is set in the `Edit Tool Performance Preferences`_



Vertex Snapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default `snapping`_ is turned off however, if desired `snapping`_
can be used during polygon geometry creation.


+ Polygon creation with snapping to the current layer. Notice that it
  didn't snap to the hospital which is in another layer (circled in red)

+ Polygon creation with snapping to the all layers. With this snapping
  it has snapped to the hospital on the second layer. > <img

+ Polygon creation with snapping to the grid. The grid is only seen

Advanced Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Polygon Creation Tool also has an advanced mode that provides all
the functionality that the `Edit Geometry Tool`_ has, except only
polygons can be edited. A summary of the advanced editing features
are:


+ Clicking an existing polygon will select it.
+ Vertices in selected polygons can be moved.
+ Vertices in selected liness can be added or deleted
+ Holding CTRL+SHIFT down will allow the entire geometry to be moved.
+ As with the `Edit Geometry Tool`_ the vertex operations can be
  performed on multiple vertices at once if many vertices are selected.
