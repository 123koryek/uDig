Using Vertex Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vertex tools are tools that modify the shape of existing geometries by
adding/removing or deleting vertices from geometries. The partial
exception is the hole cutting tool, which can create and edit holes in
polygons.

The following tools feature vertex editing:

Notes on working with vertex tools:


+ Vertexes are represented by a small square, which can be selected
  with a single click. Depending on how zoomed out you are a single
  vertex may represent many points in your original dataset.
+ The vertex will change shape during editing, as an example when
  creating a polygon the original starting point will grow larger as you
  close the polygon to provide feedback that snapping will be performed.
+ When editing animated circles are used to indicate any snapping that
  occurs; this provides a visual indicate of where you clicked and where
  the vertex was relocated to due to snapping
+ When deleting a vertex visual feedback is also provided
+ If any additional feedback is required it will be offered in the
  middle of your map as a "pop up bubble" allowing you to fix the
  problem without losing your place.
+ many of the tools support the use of the scroll wheel to change zoom
  level while editing; and the middle mouse button to support panning
