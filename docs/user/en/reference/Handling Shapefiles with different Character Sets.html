       <h3>Handling Shapefiles with different Character Sets</h3>
       <p>There are two ways to specify character set information when working with Shapefiles.</p>

<div>
<ul>
    <li><a href='#HandlingShapefileswithdifferentCharacterSets-DefaultCharacterSetfortheApplication'>Default Character Set for the Application</a></li>
    <li><a href='#HandlingShapefileswithdifferentCharacterSets-ChangeShapefileCharacterSet'>Change Shapefile Character Set</a></li>
</ul></div>

<p>The shapefile format makes use of a "dbf" database to store attribute data; depending on the character set the data is recorded in we will need to interpret the attributes differently.</p>

<p>You may need to change the character set for a shapefile if you are having trouble displaying shapefiles created using several different languages.</p>

<h1><a name="HandlingShapefileswithdifferentCharacterSets-DefaultCharacterSetfortheApplication"></a>Default Character Set for the Application</h1>

<p>You can set the "Default" character set in the preferences dialog. (Do a search for character set).  This declares the character set that will be used the first time a shapefile is added to the catalog or to a map.</p>

<p>This setting can be helpful if your organization works with many shapefiles created with the same language.</p>

<h1><a name="HandlingShapefileswithdifferentCharacterSets-ChangeShapefileCharacterSet"></a>Change Shapefile Character Set</h1>

<p>Once a Shapefile is in the catalog its Character set can be modified by:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Selecting the Shapefile Service (the top level object in the catalog)</li>
	<li>Using the "Change Character Set" Operation - this can also be found in the context menu or in the Data&gt;Resource menu.</li>
</ol>


<p>For convenience you can select many Shapefiles and change them all with a single operation.</p>
