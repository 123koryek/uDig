       <h3>Feature Type</h3>
       <p>The concept of a Feature Type is used to name and describe set of vector data (known as a Feature Collection). This terminology comes from the Web Feature Server specification; which is a web service that publishes the definition of a feature types; along with vector data that matches that type.</p>

<p>A Feature Type consists of several interesting parts:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a type name - this is the name of the content; it could be as informal as the filename that contains the content; or it could be a formal name provided the organization making the information available.</li>
	<li>attribute types; describe the information recorded about the features</li>
	<li>a default geometry; this is the geometry that is drawn on the map (unless you are more specific)</li>
</ul>


<p>You can think of a feature collection as being the data; and the feature type as being a description of that data.</p>
