Working with Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image data is widely used as a source of geospatial data. Often images
are used as a simple background layer with the pixel colours providing
content for information on screen. Raw raster information is also used
for more serious anaylisis where the information is treated as a grid
coverage of measurements for datasets such as a digital elevation
model.
