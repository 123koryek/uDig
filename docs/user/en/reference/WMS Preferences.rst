+ Image order - Not all Web Map Servers provide all image types as
  output images. The image order sets the order in which the image types
  are prioritized. For example png is usually preferred over jpg because
  it has an alpha channel so layers below the wms layer can be seen
  through a png (in transparent locations) but not through a jpg. >
  However, on the macintosh certain png images can not be decoded so gif
  is often preferred over a png images on macintosh computers.<br > As
  stated this is an advanced option so do not modify it unless you
  understand the image formats and the ramifications of using one image
  type over another.
