Using the Legend View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Legend View is used to categorize and group layers into folders.
In addition, utility features such as changing the layers' rendering
order (z order), toggling layers' visibility in the view and toggling
grid view's visibility on the map are also available. Also, all
standard layer operations, such as changing layer style and zooming to
layer, that are available on the Layers View are also available in
this view.
