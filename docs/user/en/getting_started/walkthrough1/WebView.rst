Web View
--------

In this section you will learn how to use the embedded web browser. The web browser
automatically recognizes spatial data and will open links in your current map
as you browse online catalogs.


1. Create a new map and rename the map to be called :guilabel:`Canada`.

2. Switch to the :guilabel:`Web` view by selected its tab located along
   the bottom of the workbench window next to the :guilabel:`Catalog` view.
   
3. Click on the WMS link for :guilabel:`dm solutions`.

4. The :guilabel:`Add Layer` wizard will open (uDig automatically recognize
   links to spatial content).
   
   Choose the :guilabel:`Parks`, :guilabel:`Provice`, :guilabel:`Roads`
   and :guilabel:`Cities` layers and press :guilabel:`Finish`.

   * You can use the :guilabel:`Web` view with your own website
     for easy spatial visualization.
