Adding Layers from the Catalog View
-----------------------------------

In this section you will learn how to add additional layers to your map from a previously connected data source (the DM Solutions WMS).

Adding a Layer from a previously connected WMS:

* In the
  Catalog
  view of uDig expand the Catalog record for the
  GMap WMS Demo Server
  by clicking on the triangle beside the record
  .
  Right-click on
  Railroads
  and select
  Add to Current Map
  .

* The new layer will appear in the
  Layers
  view, and it will automatically start to render. When it finishes rendering, you should see a new
  Railroads
  layer drawn as purple lines.

* The catalog also comes equipped with a built in service called “Decoration”. Select
  Decoration > Scalebar
  in the Catalog view and drag this layer onto the Map

* The Scalebar is added to the top left corner of your map.


* You can now close the Map Editor using the small
  x
  next to the map name. Available maps including this one are shown in the
  Projects
  view.
