Adding Layers from the Catalog View
-----------------------------------

In this section you will learn how to add additional layers to your map from a previously connected data source (the DM Solutions WMS).

Adding a Layer from a previously connected WMS:

* In the :guilabel:`Catalog` view expand the record for the
  :guilabel:`GMap WMS Demo Server` by clicking on the triangle beside the record.

* Right-click on :guilabel:`Railroads` and select :guilabel:`Add to Current Map`.

  .. image:: images/catalog_add_to_current_map.png
    :width: 12.719cm
    :height: 3.979cm

* The new layer will appear in the :guilabel:`Layers` view and automatically start to render.
   
  .. image:: images/wms_railways.png
    :width: 14.861cm
    :height: 11.15cm

   When it finishes rendering, you should see a new :guilabel:`Railroads` layer drawn on screen.

* The catalog also comes equipped with a built in service called :guilabel:`Decoration`.
   
   Select :menuselection:`Decoration --> Scalebar` in the :guilabel:`Catalog` view and drag this
   layer onto the Map
   

  .. image:: images/catalog_decorator_scalebar.png
    :width: 11cm
    :height: 9.58cm


   The Scalebar is added to the top left corner of your map.

* You can now close the Map Editor using the small :guilabel:`x` next to the map name.
  
* Available maps including this one are shown in the :guilabel:`Projects` view if you 
  would like to open your map again.
